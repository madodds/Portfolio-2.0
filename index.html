                    It Takes a Village (ITAV) is like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_Plays_Pok%C3%A9mon">Twitch Plays Pokemon</a> meets <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi">Tamagotchi</a>. 
                    ITAV is built to run on a server, streaming to <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/">twitch.tv</a>, and accepting commands from the channel's chat group. 
                    The chat must attempt to keep the pet alive as long as possible by voting on what to do. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was made for the <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/it-takes-village">Global Game Jam 2015</a>, so we (a group of 3) only had a weekend to build it.
                    I later refactored / de-bugged the code and <a href="https://github.com/madodds/GGJ-ItTakesAVillage">put it on GitHub</a>, where you can learn more and see the source code.

                    The Game Idea Generator randomly generates an idea for a video game project. 
                    This was originally written in C# windows forms, which you can find on GitHub. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea's attributes are retrieved from a <a href="https://github.com/madodds/Game-Idea-Generator/blob/master/Attributes.json">JSON file on my GitHub account.</a>
                    The attributes chosen are based on randomly generated numbers that are unique to each other. 
                    These numbers get placed into the index of 5 arrays: Genres, Perks, Settings, Styles, and Engines.

                    Sphere Dash is a side-scrolling platformer, where the environment is dynamically created. 
                    Your objective is to go very fast for as long as possible without falling off. 
                    There is no limit to how fast you can go.
                    There are 3 different levels, and a tutorial level. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This game was originally made in 2012 as a project to learn Unity, but was expanded on as my graduation project. This game was judged as one of the top games of my graduating class.

                    <!--I am an undergraduate student at University of Colorado at Colorado Springs majoring in Game Design. 
                    My intended time to graduate is Spring 2013.
			        My coding languages include: C++, C#/XNA, Python, ActionScript 3.0, HTML/CSS, JavaScript/Ajax

			        Software I am familiar with: Blender, Adobe Flash CS5.5, Unity, GameMaker, RPG maker, TortoiseHg, Microsoft Visual Studio, and much more

			        I was handed a controller at 2 years old and never stopped playing. 
                    I grew up seeking knowledge in game design and music composition. 
                    I dreamed of working at Blizzard Entertainment and greatly admired Final Fantasy Composer Nobuo Uematsu. 
                    I also represent the top 2% of StarCraft II players in the Americas and South Korea. -->
                    For each "cell" I spawn a Rectangle of random width and length within some radius. Again the radius doesn't matter too much, but it should probably be proportionate to the number of cells.
Instead of using uniformly distributed random numbers (the default Math.random generator in most languages), I'm using Park-Miller Normal Distribution[3] . This skews the size of the cells so that they are more likely to be of a small size (more smaller cells, less larger cells). The reason for this will be explained later!
In addition to this I ensure that the ratio between the width and length of each cell is not too large, we don't want perfectly square rooms but neither do we want really skinny ones, but somewhere in between.
